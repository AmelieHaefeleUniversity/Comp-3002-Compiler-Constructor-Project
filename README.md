# Comp-3002-Compiler-Constructor-Project

Note: Some of the starting structure code was given my professor which is why there are "created by Wilf Lalonde" referfences in it. The majority of the code and all the FSM/Parser logic is written by me. If want specific clarification please feel free to reach out to me!

--Do not copy this code please--

Preface:
This project was done for my comp 3002 course and is broken up into 6 different assignments each building on the last so if you just want to check out the result you can look at the assignment 5 folder. 

How to Run:
To run it download assignment 5[most stable version] (or any version you want) and navigate to main.swift on xcode and build it from that file. I have have included some toy Grammars you can use and play around with. The output is the created finite state machines from the inputted grammars. A very basic explationation is it that the grammar gives instructions on what FSMs [Finite State Machine] trees to build (think trees from depth first search algorithms). The ouput you get are those built FSMs and their properties ie Read only that change how they get built further.

--In progress come back later :D--
